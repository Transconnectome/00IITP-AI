    print("## 1. Challenge: 'Is this just a fancy RAG?'")
    print("   - **Critique**: You claim 'Homeostatic Memory', but if it's just fetching documents based on a 'hunger' variable, it's just RAG with a prompt hack.")
    print("   - **Fix Requirement**: You must explain the *mathematical* integration. The 'Drive' must modulate the **State Update Equation ($)**, not just the input prompt.")
    
    print("\n## 2. Challenge: 'Why SSM? Why not Transformer?'")
    print("   - **Critique**: Reviewers know Transformers work. SSMs are niche. Why take the risk?")
    print("   - **Winning Argument**: 'Transformers Reset. Life Doesn't.' Emphasize that **Continuous Learning = Continuous State**. Transformers cannot do true Continual Learning without massive retraining. SSMs can evolve $ incrementally.")
    
    print("\n## 3. Challenge: 'The Hallucination Problem'")
    print("   - **Critique**: Generative Replay (Dreaming) sounds like Hallucination.")
    print("   - **Defense**: 'Hallucination' is bad when ungrounded. 'Dreaming' is grounded **Optimization**. We must frame SWR Replay as **'Data Compression for Consistency'**.")
    
    print("\n## 4. The 'Killer Feature' Missing")
    print("   - **Observation**: You mention 'Gastric Distension' a lot. It sounds almost *too* specific/biological.")
    print("   - **Suggestion**: Generalize 'Gastric' to **Interoceptive Valence Signal (IVS)**. Gastric is the *proof of concept* (Aim 1), but the *technology* is the IVS-Gated Engine.")
