# Skill: Evidence Synthesis (SSM/Titans)

## Goal

Gather and synthesize academic references to support the technical superiority of the proposed "Titans" model over traditional Transformers.

## Implementation

1. **Search**: Use `arXiv`, `Semantic Scholar` MCPs.
    - Keywords: "State Space Models", "Mamba", "Titans Memory", "Linear Attention", "Multisensory Integration".
2. **Screen**: Filter for high-impact papers (CVPR, NeurIPS, Nature/Science) from 2024-2025.
3. **Matrix**: Populate the Evidence Matrix.
    - Columns: Reference, Method, Limitation (of Transformer), Solution (SSM), Relevance to NeuroX.

## Output

- `docs/02_literature/evidence_matrix_ssm.md`
