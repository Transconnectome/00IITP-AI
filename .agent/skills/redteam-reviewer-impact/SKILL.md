# Skill: Red Team Reviewer (Impact)

## Goal

Identify weaknesses in the proposal before submission, specifically focusing on "Innovation" and "Feasibility".

## Implementation

1. **Persona**: Adopt the persona of a senior IITP evaluator (skeptical of "buzzwords", looking for concrete substantiation).
2. **Checklist**:
    - Is "Titans" really better than GPT-4? Where is the proof?
    - Is the collaboration real or just a list of names?
    - Are the KPIs realistic?
3. **Report**: List Top 10 Critical Issues.

## Output
