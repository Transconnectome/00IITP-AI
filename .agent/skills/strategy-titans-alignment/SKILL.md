# Skill: Strategy Alignment (Titans & SSM)

## Goal

Ensure that any generated text, outline, or plan aligns perfectly with the core strategic pillars:

1. **Two-Part Model**: Sensory Encoder + Titans (Neural Memory)
2. **Multisensory Integration**: Reliability-weighted integration.
3. **Efficiency**: Spiking / Event-based / Linear Attention.

## Implementation

1. **Load Strategy**: Read `docs/01_project_planning/email_analysis_and_insights.md`.
2. **Check Alignment**: Compare input content against the "Two-Part Model" definition.
    - Does it mention "Predictive Coding" for Part 1?
    - Does it mention "Bayesian Surprisal" for Part 2?
    - Are R&R roles consistent (e.g., Prof. Cha -> Scaling)?
3. **Report**: Generate a gap analysis report.

## Output

- `docs/01_project_planning/strategy_alignment_report.md`
