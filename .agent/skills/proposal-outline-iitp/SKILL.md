# Skill: Proposal Outline (IITP Standard)

## Goal

Create a structured proposal outline that satisfies IITP evaluation criteria while embedding the NeuroX technical narrative.

## Implementation

1. **Analyze RFP**: Read `docs/00_task_description/raw/` files (RFP).
2. **Embed Narrative**: Map "Two-Part Model" to the "Tech Development" section.
3. **Assign Roles**: Map Professors (Lee, Son, Kim, etc.) to specific Work Packages (WP).
4. **Structure**: Use standard IITP headers (1. Necessity, 2. Goals, 3. Contents, 4. R&D Capability).

## Output

- `docs/01_project_planning/outline_iitp_v1.md`
- `docs/01_project_planning/wbs_assignment.md`
