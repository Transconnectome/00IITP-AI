# Red Team Review (Round 2)
**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Target**: `docs/03_proposal/PROPOSAL_PLAN.md` (Revised)
**Reviewer Persona**: Senior IITP Project Manager

## 1. Overall Verdict: **ACCEPT (with minor suggestions)**
The revised proposal now significantly aligns with the IITP RFP (2026-AI-010~014) and the IdeaDeck. The inclusion of **Proprioception/Tactile** and **LTC/Neural ODEs** addresses the critical "Embodiment" and "Scientific Novelty" gaps. Reframing "Wellness" to **"Predictive Allostasis"** elevates the application to a foundational research level.

## 2. Improvements Verified
1.  **Embodiment**: "Sensory-Motor Encoder" now explicitly includes Proprioception, satisfying RFP-013.
2.  **Attention**: "Top-down Selective Attention" is explicitly integrated into the Titans block, addressing RFP-010/014.
3.  **Scientific Depth**: Mentioning "LTC/Neural ODE" aligns perfectly with the IdeaDeck's "Microscale" architecture.
4.  **Application Logic**: "Allostatic Neuro-Twin" is a robust, scientifically grounded concept that fits the "Brain-inspired AI" theme better than "Wellness Agent."

## 3. Remaining Minor Issues (Alignment Check)
-   **RFP-014 (Data Semanticization)**: The plan implicitly covers this via "Titans Memory," but could be more explicit about "Semantic Linkage" in Part 2.
-   **Idea Deck**: "Self-restoration" is well-covered by "Allostatic Regulation."

## 4. Final Recommendation
Proceed to **Drafting Phase**. The plan is now robust, scientifically valid, and RFP-compliant. The "Dual Encoder + Titans + Allostasis" narrative is a strong, winning strategy.
