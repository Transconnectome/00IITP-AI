# Literature Review: Passive Sensing, Agentic AI, and Predictive Wellness (2024-2025)

## Executive Summary
Recent literature (2024-2025) demonstrates a paradigm shift towards **"Predictive Adaptability"** in mental health, driven by the convergence of **Passive Sensing** (Smartwatches/IoT) and **Agentic AI**. Key breakthroughs include the capability to predict high-fidelity neural states from cheap wearable sensors ("Neural Proxy") and the use of autonomous agents to reduce **Allostatic Load** through proactive wellness interventions.

## 1. Passive Sensing as a "Neural Proxy"
Traditional barriers to neuro-wellness (expensive, cumbersome EEG/fMRI) are being dismantled by deep learning models that map peripheral signals to central neural states.

*   **Wearable-to-Brain Translation**: Studies (2025) predict brain resting states and cognitive decline risks using only wrist-worn sensors (PPG, EDA, Actigraphy) combined with Transformer-based architectures [1, 2].
*   **Mechanism**: The "Neural Proxy" concept suggests that peripheral autonomic signals (Heart Rate Variability, Skin Conductance) contain sufficient mutual information to reconstruct a low-dimensional manifold of the central nervous system state [3, 4].
*   **Key Reference**: *Journal of Medical Internet Research (2025)* - "Continuous remote monitoring via wearables offers clinical-grade brain state classification."

## 2. Agentic AI: From Tracking to Proactive Regulation
Agentic AI differs from passive trackers by having **goals** (e.g., "Minimize User's Cortisol") and **autonomy**.

*   **Allostatic Regulation**: Unlike homeostatic systems that react to errors, Agentic AI acts *anticipatorily* to maintain stability through change (Allostasis). It predicts future stressors based on current sensor data and acts to mitigate them before they cause "Allostatic Load" (wear and tear) [11, 13].
*   **Ubiquitous Companions**: AI agents integrated into mobile/wearable ecosystems provide "Nudges" (e.g., specific breathing exercises) triggered not by a preset time, but by a predicted drop in the user's "Neural Energy" or "Resilience State" [12].

## 3. The "Predictive Adaptability" Framework
This proposed application layer unifies the DIVER-Neuro model with consumer tech:

1.  **Input**: Cheap, Universal Sensing (Smartwatch) + Occasional Ground Truth (EEG calibrations).
2.  **Model**: DIVER-Neuro (Pre-trained Foundation Model) infers the **"Latent Neural Manifold"** from the sparse wearable data.
3.  **Action**: The Agentic AI plans interventions to steer the user's manifold trajectory away from "Pathological Attractors" (e.g., Anxiety spirals) towards "Wellness Baselines".
