# Strategy Logic Alignment: From Core Vision to Neuro-GINR Implementation

## 1. The Core Vision (from Strategy Deck)
**Goal**: "Robust and Efficient Multisensory Integrated Intelligence"
**Key Pillars**:
1.  **Micro**: Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) for continuous dynamics.
2.  **Macro**: Global Neural Workspace (GNW) for integration.
3.  **Mechanism**: Concept-Driven Selective Attention (Top-down).
4.  **Motivation**: Interoception & Alostasis (Homeostasis).

## 2. Neuro-GINR: The "Optimal Implementation" Logic

We argue that **Neuro-GINR + Titans-Mamba** is not just *compatible* with the Core Strategy, but is its **most advanced mathematical realization**.

### Logic 1: From LTC (Micro) to GINR (Universal Field)
> **"Generalizing Continuity from Time to Space-Time"**
-   **Core Request**: LTCs are requested for their "continuous-time" capability to handle irregular sensory data.
-   **Our Solution (Neuro-GINR)**: We upgrade LTC to **GINR (Geometry-Invariant Neural Representation)**.
-   **Logic**: LTC is continuous in *Time* ($t$). GINR is continuous in *Space-Time* ($x, t$). This allows us to handle not just irregular sampling intervals (LTC's strength), but also **irregular sensor placements** (e.g., different EEG layouts, Mouse vs. Human brain maps).
-   **Persuasion Point**: "LTC handles the *When*, GINR handles the *Where* and *When*. It is the Super-set of LTC."

### Logic 2: From GNW (Macro) to Titans-Mamba
> **"Linearizing the Global Workspace"**
-   **Core Request**: Global Neural Workspace (GNW) for multimodal integration.
-   **Our Solution (Titans-Mamba)**: We implement the GNW's "Broadcasting" mechanism using **Mamba (SSM)**.
-   **Logic**: A true GNW requires "Global Access" to all past information. Transformers fail at this for long durations ($O(N^2)$). Mamba's linear scaling ($O(N)$) enables a **"24-Hour Global Workspace"**, allowing the AI to maintain a full day's context—essential for circadian rhythm and mental health monitoring.
-   **Integration**: The "Bayesian Surprisal Gate" acts as the **"Ignition"** mechanism of GNW, allowing only "conscious-worthy" (surprising) information to enter the global workspace.

### Logic 3: Concept-Driven Attention = Homeostasis-Driven Gate
> **"Biologically Grounded Selection"**
-   **Core Request**: Concept-driven selective attention.
-   **Our Solution (Interoceptive Field)**: We define the "Root Concept" as the **"Self" (Homeostasis)**.
-   **Logic**: Attention should not just be "task-driven" but "state-driven". Our **Part 3 (Interoceptive Field)** provides the *motivation* for attention.
    -   *Example*: If "Surprisal" in the GINR-Heart field is high (Anxiety), the Titans Memory automatically biases attention towards "Safety-seeking" inputs (Visual threats).
-   **Persuasion Point**: "We implement Volition (의지) through Machine Homeostasis."

## 3. Optimized Research Pipeline

| Step | Core Strategy Goal | Neuro-GINR Implementation | Optimization Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Real-World Sensory Data** | **Cross-Species Generative Bridge** | Don't just collect data; *generate* missing cross-species links (Mouse $\leftrightarrow$ Human) to maximize data utility. |
| **2** | **Multiscale Modeling** | **Micro(GINR) $\rightarrow$ Macro(Mamba)** | unified mathematical framework (Neural Fields) prevents "Module Friction" between Micro/Macro layers. |
| **3** | **Selective Attention** | **Surprisal-Based Gating** | Replaces heuristic attention with rigorous **Bayesian Information Theory** (Free Energy Principle). |
| **4** | **Evaluation** | **Generative Diagnosis** | Validates not just via accuracy metrics, but by **"generating"** healthy/pathological brain states (Digital Twin). |
