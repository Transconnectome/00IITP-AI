=== NeuroX-OS: AI-CoScientist Synergy Analysis ===

## 1. Research Identity: 'Inside-Out Multisensory SSM'

- **Problem**: Current AI is 'Outside-In' (passive mapping of stimulus to label).
- **Solution**: Build a **'Homeostatic Titans Memory'** system centered on Professor Kim's gastric distension (interoceptive) signals.
- **Mechanism**: The 'Virtual Stomach' (Internal State) drives the 'Sensory Encoder' (Multisensory Integration).

## 2. Technical Aim Integration

### Aim 1: Interoceptive Sensory Encoder (Bridging Part 1 & Interoception)
- **Task**: Instead of purely visual/auditory JEPA, implement an 'Interoceptive Feature Extractor'.
- **Data**: Use Prof. Kim's 2-photon/fiber photometry data (NE signals in aIC/PVH) as a 'ground truth' for internal value weighting.

### Aim 2: Drive-Modulated Titans Memory (Bridging Part 2 & HRRL)
- **Task**: Modify the Titans Memory SSM to include a 'Drive Function' ((H_t)$).
- **Logic**: High neuro-metabolic cost (simulated) or high 'prediction error' triggers a shift toward exploration mode.

### Aim 3: Reafferent Grounding for Robotic Embodiment
- **Task**: Test the model in a closed-loop scenario (like the 'Tissue culture' example).
- **Validation**: The AI must demonstrate 'Information Creation' by matching its internal motor commands with sensory reafference (Grounding).

## 3. Synergy with Existing Skills
- ****: Update with Duriez & Gutkin (2023) and Keramati & Gutkin (2014) as the theoretical foundation for RL-Homeostasis coupling.
- ****: Update the 'Two-Part Model' to a 'Three-Part Loop' (Interoception -> Titans Memory -> Action/Reafference).
